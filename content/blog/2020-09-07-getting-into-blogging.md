So, this is the start of a blogging journey which I hopefully will keep exploring. I've been pondering for some time if I should get into blogging, the purpose beeing multifold;

- **Having a place to document my own learning.**
I sometimes find myself researching the same topics over and over again and having a place for myself to collect my findings and thoughts on topics thats interests me and might be of use to someone else as well seems like a good idea.

- **Enhance my own learning.** 
If there is something that forces you to actually learn - it is writing about it for others to learn.

- **Contributing and sharing knowledge.**
Hopefully, someone else might actually learn something from this blog.

- **Marketing.**
I have a lingering idea that I might try freelancing at some time in the future and building a web presence is a part of this. Blogging is a great marketing tool.

- **Doing something useful instead of...not doing it.**
This blog and web page is in itself also a place for me to learn and explore technology, design and communication. Instead of gaming or wasting time on twitter, tinkering with this project seems like a more fruitful endeavor.
